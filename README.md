## Why

Collecting feedback should not cost $79 a month or a weekend of Docker.
Every open source feedback tool needs a VPS, Postgres and someone to babysit
it, and most of them look like an admin template.

openheard is one Cloudflare Worker and one D1 database. It deploys in two
commands, runs on the free tier, and is designed like a product people would
pay for. Self-hosting is the default, not the afterthought.

## Features

**Collect**
- Public board with voting, search, sorting and keyboard navigation
- Posts with comments, reactions and a status timeline
- Anonymous voting, sign-in gate on posting, optional approval queue
- Sign in through an external SSO provider; public pages remain readable without an account

**Manage**
- Dashboard with inbox, internal notes, merge, pin, tags and ETA
- Custom statuses that drive the roadmap columns
- Team invites, admin and member roles, join links
- Import from a CSV export of Canny or similar tools; export to JSON and CSV

**Publish**
- Roadmap with drag between columns
- Changelog with an editor, linked shipped posts and an RSS feed
- Branding: accent colour pulled from your website, board name

**Extend**
- HTTP API with per-workspace keys at `/api/v1` ([docs](docs/api.md))
- MCP server at `/api/mcp` so Claude, Cursor and other agents can read and
  triage feedback ([docs](docs/mcp.md))
- Multi-workspace: each workspace lives on its own subdomain

Coming next: image uploads, changelog email subscribers, an embeddable widget,
a CLI and a docs site.

## Get started

### Cloud

Sign up at [openheard.com](https://openheard.com). Your board lives at
`<slug>.openheard.com`. There is a free tier.

### Self-host on Cloudflare

Needs a Cloudflare account. Everything fits in the free tier.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Heilonng23/openheard && cd openheard
bun install
cp packages/infra/.env.example packages/infra/.env   # set auth secret and SSO provider
cd packages/infra && bunx alchemy login --configure && cd ../..
bun run deploy
```

Before deploying, set `SSO_AUTHORIZE_URL`, `SSO_TOKEN_URL`,
`SSO_PROVIDER_ID`, and `SSO_ADMIN_USER_ID` in `packages/infra/.env`. Register
this site's exact `https://<your-openheard-host>/api/sso/callback` URL with
the provider. `SSO_PROVIDER_ID` is a stable namespace for account IDs; do not
change it after users have signed in. Set the admin ID to the intended owner's
ID from that provider before the first sign-in; arriving first does not grant
admin access. OpenHeard has no separate public password, magic link or Google
login. Public boards, roadmaps and changelogs remain readable without signing
in.

OpenHeard uses the `openheard` session cookie prefix (`openheard-demo` for the
demo), so local SSO testing on the same hostname does not replace the identity
provider's session cookie.

The external provider must support a fixed callback and a short-lived,
single-use authorization code with PKCE S256. OpenHeard redirects to
`SSO_AUTHORIZE_URL` with `state`, `code_challenge`, and
`code_challenge_method=S256`; the provider returns `code` and `state` to the
callback. OpenHeard then POSTs JSON `{ "code": "...", "code_verifier": "..." }`
to `SSO_TOKEN_URL`. A successful response is
`{ "user": { "id": "stable-subject", "email": "user@example.com", "name": "User" } }`.
Both URLs must use HTTPS except on localhost or 127.0.0.1. The token endpoint
must validate the verifier, return the identity only once, and supply a
verified email address. This is the
OpenHeard SSO contract; an OIDC provider needs an adapter to this contract.

For Webox, use `https://<webox-host>/api/sso/authorize` and
`https://<webox-host>/api/sso/token`, set `SSO_PROVIDER_ID=webox`, and set
Webox's `SSO_CLIENT_CALLBACK_URL` to the OpenHeard callback above. The
namespace `webox` preserves accounts created by the earlier Webox-specific
fork branch.

To use the Webox icon for this deployment, set
`VITE_SITE_ICON_URL=/brands/webox.svg` and
`VITE_SITE_TOUCH_ICON_URL=/brands/webox-apple-touch-icon.png` in
`apps/web/.env` before building.
These optional settings control the browser favicon, Apple touch icon, and
in-app mark; without them the fork keeps OpenHeard's icons. Other projects can
put their own SVG and PNG in `apps/web/public` and set the same paths.

Deployment is separate from Webox. The commands above provision the Worker,
D1 and KV, apply migrations and print the URL; run them only when you are ready
to publish the feedback service.

### Run locally

No Cloudflare account needed. A SQLite file stands in for D1.

```bash
bun install
bun run db:push:local   # creates apps/web/local.db
bun run dev:local       # http://localhost:3001
bun run db:seed         # optional demo posts
```

Keyboard on the board: `j` `k` move, `v` vote, `enter` open, `/` search,
`c` new post.

## License

The app (`apps/web`, `packages/db`, `packages/auth`, `packages/ui`) is
[AGPL-3.0](LICENSE). Self-host it freely; if you run a modified version as a
service, publish your changes.

The pieces you embed in your own product, the widget, the CLI and the API
client, will ship under MIT in their own packages so they never touch your
licence.
